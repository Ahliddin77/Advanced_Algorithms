Findings:
We may see the following patterns based on the output:
 The execution time of all algorithms typically increases as the length of the text grows.
 The brute-force approach has the shortest time to execute for shorter text lengths but grows 
slower as text length rises.
 The Sunday method regularly outperforms other algorithms over a wide range of text lengths.
 The KMP method also runs well and has a very consistent execution time across varying text 
lengths.
 For all text lengths, the Rabin-Karp method takes longer to execute than the other algorithms.
 The execution time of the Gusfield Z algorithm is comparable to that of the KMP and Sunday 
algorithms
