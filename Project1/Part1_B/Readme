Implementations of four string pattern matching algorithms are included in the code: Binary Sunday, 
Gusfield Z, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), and Rabin-Karp. The main function calculates the time it takes 
each method to match a given pattern inside a text.

The output shows that the 
execution times for the algorithms drop from Binary Sunday to Gusfield Z, KMP, and Rabin-Karp, in that 
order. This shows that Rabin-Karp is the quickest of the four algorithms for the given input.
