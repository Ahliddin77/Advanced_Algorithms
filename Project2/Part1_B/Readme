In the Triwizard Tournament, code solves the challenge of predicting which wizard will reach the exit first.
The approach uses the BFS idea to determine the shortest path to the exit for each wizard. It picks the 
winner based on the least overall time for each wizard by dividing the shortest path distance by their 
speed.If a winner is discovered, the program displays "Wizard X wins the Triwizard Tournament!" where 
X is the victorious wizard's index plus one. If no winner is identified (i.e., no wizard can reach the exit), it 
returns "No winner." Any wizard cannot reach the exit."
