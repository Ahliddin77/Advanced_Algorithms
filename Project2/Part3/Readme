Separate Chaining, Linear Probing, and Double Hashing are the three hash table implementations used in
the code. The code compares search and insert times for each implementation under various load 
conditions. The code's main objective is to compare the performance (search and insert times) of the three hash 
table implementations under varying load conditions. Divide the number of items by the table size to get
the load factor. You may see and compare the performance of the hash tables under different conditions 
by adjusting the numElements and capacity settings in the main function.
