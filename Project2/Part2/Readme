The code handles the challenge of organizing a sitting plan for Aunt Petunia's birthday celebration.
To investigate alternative seating configurations, the solution employs a recursive DFS algorithm. It uses 
the isValidSeat method to validate each guest-seat assignment and returns when there is a dispute. The 
algorithm will keep running until a proper arrangement is identified or all options have been explored.
